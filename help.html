            <p class="title">What is Stacked Breathing?</p>
            <ul class="content">
              <li>
                Stacked Breathing is an exercise that helps you take deeper
                breaths than you might otherwise be able to
              </li>
              <li>
                In the short term, this helps you breathe more easily by
                dislodging fluids from lungs and clearing your airways
              </li>
              <li>
                With practice, breath stacking can help strenghten your muscles
                and ease your beathing more generally

            <p class="title">What is PEP Therapy?</p>
            <ul class="content">
              <li>
                PEP Therapy is an exercise that helps loosen and clear mucus
                that gets trapped in your airway
              </li>
              <li>
                During this exercise, you blow forcefully through pursed lips
                (e.g., the same way you would blow out candles ona birthday
                cake)
              </li>

                If your health-care provider has suggested a breathing
                resistance device (e.g., a Breather or Flutter), you can
                optionally use it with this game.

            Bubble Breather uses your device's speaker and microphone to sense
            your breathing.

            <b>Supported Devices</b>
            <br />
            While the long-term goal of the game is to support a wireless breath
            sensing on a wide range of mobile devices, the game has currently
            been confirmed to function correctly on the suported devices list
            below.

              <b>Allowing Microphone Access</b>
              <br />
              When first loading Bubble Breather, you will be prompted to allow
              the webpage to “access your microphone”. Microphone access must be
              proved to allow in-game breath controls. Note that all audio data is
              processed locally - no data shared or sent to third parties.
            </p>

            <b>Microphone Troubleshooting</b>
            <br />
            Ensure volume is unmuted: Bubble Breather relies on high-frequency sound to detect your breathing patterns - make sure your device's audio is unmuted and set to a high level.
            <br />
            <br />
            Position yourself close to your device: Bubble Breather breath sensing is most accurate when you are positioned close to your device -- for best results, try to maintain a 50 - 75cm distance from your device during gameplay.
            <br />
            <br />
            Play in a quiet area: Background noise can interfere with Bubble Breather’s breath sensing accuracy - for best results, make sure you play the game in a fairly quiet setting.
            <br />
            <br />
            Avoid unnecessary movement: Bubble Breather senses your breathing by detecting subtle movements in your chest and abdomen -- therefore, any large movements can interfere with the games ability to sense your breathing accurately.
